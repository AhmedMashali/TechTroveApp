                </h2>
                <p className='leading-relaxed text-gray-700'>
                    Started by a group of developers who love writing and
                    teaching, this blog was born out of a desire to give back to
                    the community and document our journey through tech. We
                    believe in simplicity, clarity, and learning by sharing.
